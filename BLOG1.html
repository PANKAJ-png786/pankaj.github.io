    <img src="file:///C:/Users/jai%20Baba%20Mohan%20Das%20K/Desktop/travel.jpg" alt="Travel Image">
    <p>Traveling is one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences, but many people think it’s too expensive. The good news? You don’t need to be rich to explore the world! With some smart planning and insider tips, you can enjoy amazing trips without breaking the bank.</p>

    <h2>1. Plan Ahead, But Stay Flexible</h2>
    <p>Booking flights and accommodation early can save you a lot, but sometimes last-minute deals pop up too. Use apps and websites like Skyscanner, Google Flights, or Hopper to track prices and snag the best offers.</p>

    <h2>2. Travel Off-Season</h2>
    <p>Avoid peak holiday times when prices skyrocket. Traveling during shoulder seasons or off-peak months means fewer crowds and cheaper rates on hotels and activities.</p>

    <h2>3. Choose Affordable Destinations</h2>
    <p>Some countries are much friendlier to your wallet than others. Southeast Asia, parts of Eastern Europe, and Central America are known for budget-friendly options without sacrificing culture or fun.</p>

    <h2>4. Use Public Transport and Walk</h2>
    <p>Skip taxis and rental cars when possible. Public transport is cheaper and offers a more authentic experience. Plus, walking lets you discover hidden gems in a city!</p>

    <h2>5. Stay in Hostels, Guesthouses, or Use Home Sharing</h2>
    <p>Instead of expensive hotels, try hostels, budget guesthouses, or platforms like Airbnb. You can also consider house-sitting or Couchsurfing for free stays.</p>

    <h2>6. Eat Like a Local</h2>
    <p>Street food and local markets offer delicious meals at a fraction of restaurant prices. It’s also a great way to experience local culture and flavors.</p>

    <h2>7. Keep Track of Your Expenses</h2>
    <p>Use budgeting apps or just a simple spreadsheet to monitor your spending daily. It helps you avoid surprises and keeps your travel budget intact.</p>

    <p><strong>Traveling on a budget is all about being smart, adventurous, and open to new experiences. With these tips, I hope you feel inspired to start planning your next affordable getaway!</strong></p>
